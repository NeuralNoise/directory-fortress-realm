      <p>
         This package is the Java Sentry component.  The Fortress Java Sentry provides APIs that are used by
          Java EE applications to perform authentication, authorization and audit within runtime
          application server environments.  The APIs are not called directly by outside client programs rather they
          are called by the application servers during runtime policy enforcement.

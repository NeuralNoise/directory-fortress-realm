      <p>
         This package is the Realm Manager component.  The Fortress Realm Manager provides APIs that are used by the Fortress Realm
          implementation to perform authentication, authorization and audit within runtime application server environments.
          The APIs are not called directly by outside client programs rather they are called by the Fortress Realm itself.
